<h1> Definition of Green Infrastructure </h1>
<p> Green infrastructure refers to a network of natural and engineered systems that mimic
     natural processes to manage water sustainably.
    Examples include wetlands, bioswales, and green roofs, which help retain, filter, and slow down water flow 
    reducing reliance on traditional gray infrastructure like pipes and sewers.</p>
