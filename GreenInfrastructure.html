<h1> Definition of Green Infrastructure </h1>
<p> Green infrastructure refers to a network of natural and engineered systems that mimic
     natural processes to manage water sustainably.
    Examples include wetlands, bioswales, and green roofs, which help retain, filter, and slow down water flow 
    reducing reliance on traditional gray infrastructure like pipes and sewers.</p>

<h2 style="color:FloralWhite;"> Benefits of Green Infrastructure</h2>
<ul style="text-align: center;"></ul>
    <li style="color:FloralWhite;"><b>Flood Reduction:</b> Absorbs excess, rainwater, preventing overflow into urban areas.</li>
    <li style="color:FloralWhite;"><b>Improved Water Quality:</b> Filter pollutants before water reaches rivers and oceans.</li>
    <li style="color:FloralWhite;"><b>Biodiversity Support:</b> Creates habitats in urban rivers and oceans.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Green Infastructure</h1>
<h2>All you need to know about this topic</h2> 
<p>Water that drains from <b>bathrooms, kitchens, and other sources with plumbing </b> gets channeled 
via sewers to sewage treatment plants before it's discharged into public waterways.</p>
<p>However, most storm drains funnel rainfall directly into waterways without treatment, 
bringing with it whatever it carries in a raw state, including <b>trash, toxins, pathogens, excess sediment and nutrients,
and thermal pollution </b> (hot water that causes a sudden upswing in ambient water temperatures). </p>
<p>Stormwater runoff impacts the water we drink, the seafood we eat, and the recreational areas we visit. It introduces disease-causing pathogens
     into water supply sources that treatment facilities can't always filter out.
 And it can <b>contaminate fish and shellfish</b>, which in turn can sicken us.
  Rainfall runoff also inundates beach water with bacteria at levels that violate public health standards and sicken people,
  causing <i>rashes, hepatitis, and gastrointestinal illnesses. </i>
  As climate change creates more frequent, extreme weather events, our exposure to stormwater runoff pollution will increase.</p>
