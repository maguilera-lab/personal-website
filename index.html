      <p>Traditional infrastructure isn't designed to handle the increased floods and droughts that come with global warming,
         so we need a modern approach to protect public health, safety, and quality of life. Green solutions give communities the security and flexibility they need.
          Napa, CA solved flooding problems by choosing to restore the Napa River's natural channel and wetlands, rather than lining the river with concrete.
         The effort has protected 2,700 homes and prevented $26 million in flood damage each year, and has created new parks and open space.</p>

   <p>In 2022 ~85% of Los Angeles' water came from imported sources such as the Colorado River and the State Water Project in Mono Basin and Owens Valley.
    Only about 15% of our water is locally imported. California does not manage its water very well. <b>50% of that is discharged back into the enviroment, 40% is allocated for agricultual use and 10% is for residential use.</b>
