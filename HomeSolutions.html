<h1>Ways You Can Save</h1>
<p> An at homesolution can be installing cisterns for capturing rain water. 
    A cistern is a storage tank located to collect runoff water from an impervious area, most likely a roof.
    Capturing runoff water from your property reduces the quantity of stormwater discharged from your property.
     This captured water can be a source of much needed water for irrigation of vegetables and flowers, watering animals, flushing toilets, washing vehicles, driveways and walks, and in some cases washing cloths.

<p>Above is a table showing the average water usage in the U.S. from July 2024. On average, a shower lasts about 8 minutes and depending on the type of 
    shower head you use it could be spewing unnecessary gallons. Imagine you live in a household of 5.
     If everyone showers at the average 8 minute rate with the most efficient showerhead available that is still a total of 60 gallons being used.
     Now, the purpose of me sharing this infromation isn't to convince you to take shorter showers, but rather think about all the water you can and should be reusing.

<p>For as long as I could remember, my parents have always reused our shower water to water our plants in the yard. We have many fruit trees planted such as Mandarin, Plumb, Apple, Guava, and Pomagranate trees.
    I live in a household with <b>5</b> total people and let me just say that a few of these people take longer than 10 mintutes to bathe. So for us, we get so much value from reusing our water. This is actually an example of <i>Greywater Recycling</i>.</p>
